## My .vim files

I use [spf13](http://vim.spf13.com/) now. Here are my `.local` files.

Need to have this macvim/vim install:

## Vim for Mac OS X:

MacVim with if\_lua

Or, you can install MacVim with homebrew:

```
brew install macvim --with-cscope --with-lua
brew linkapps macvim

```

To install Vim (as opposed to MacVim) with homebrew:

```
brew install vim --with-lua
```
